# The building blocks of algorithms

### Sequencing
An algorithm is a step-by-step process, and the order of those steps are crucial to ensuring the correctness of an algorithm.

### Selection 
Algorithms can use selection to determine a different set of steps to execute based on a Boolean expression.

### Iteration 
Algorithms often use repetition to execute steps a certain number of times or until a condition is met.
