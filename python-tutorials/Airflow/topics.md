# Apache Airflow Tutorials

Welcome to the Apache Airflow tutorials! In this series, we'll explore various concepts and best practices related to Airflow. Each tutorial will focus on a specific topic, allowing you to gradually build your knowledge.

## 1. Key Concepts

### 1. PythonOperator

- Execute Python functions as tasks within a DAG.
- Passing arguments, returning values, and handling exceptions.

### 2. Variables

- Store and retrieve key-value pairs in Airflow.
- Define variables in the Airflow UI or programmatically.

### 3. XComs (Cross-Communication)

- Enable communication between tasks within a DAG.
- Push and pull data using XComs.

### 4. Templates and Macros

- Use template fields (e.g., `{{ ds }}`, `{{ execution_date }}`) for dynamic values.
- Explore macros (e.g., `{{ macros.ds_add(ds, 1) }}`) for date manipulation.

### 5. Connections and Hooks

- Set up database connections (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) using Airflow connections.
- Use hooks (e.g., `SqliteHook`, `HttpHook`) for external system interactions.

## 2. Additional Topics

### 6. Task Execution Order

- Understand how Airflow determines task execution order.
- Task dependencies, priority weights, and execution limits.

### 7. Dynamic Task Generation

- Generate tasks dynamically based on data or conditions.
- Examples using loops or external sources.

### 8. Advanced Trigger Rules

- Beyond basic trigger rules (e.g., `all_success`, `one_failed`).
- Custom trigger rules and use cases.

### 9. Airflow Plugins and Hooks

- Extend functionality with custom plugins.
- Create custom hooks for specific integrations.

### 10. Advanced XCom Usage

- More complex scenarios for using XComs.
- Passing structured data (e.g., dictionaries, lists) between tasks.

## 3. Further Exploration

### 11. Task Groups and Cross-DAG Dependencies

- Organize tasks within a DAG using task groups.
- Manage dependencies across multiple DAGs.

### 12. Dynamic DAGs

- Create DAGs dynamically based on external factors.
- Programmatically generate DAGs.

### 13. Managing Secrets and Credentials

- Securely handle sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords).
- Built-in support for secrets management.

### 14. Custom Executors and Executors Scaling

- Create custom executors beyond built-in options.
- Considerations for scaling with different executor types.

### 15. Airflow Web UI Customization

- Customize the Airflow UI to match your organization's branding.
- Themes, logos, and custom views.
