    "# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Type\n",
    "**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** is primarily used for:\n",
    "- **Supervised Learning**\n",
    "- **Classification** and **Regression** tasks\n",
    "- **Applications**: Image classification, recommendation systems, anomaly detection, and pattern recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How K-Nearest Neighbors Works\n",
    "- **Instance-Based Learning:**\n",
    "  - KNN is a lazy learner, meaning it does not explicitly learn a model but rather stores all training instances and uses them directly for making predictions.\n",
    "- **Distance Calculation:**\n",
    "  - To make a prediction, KNN calculates the distance between the test instance and all training instances. Common distance metrics include Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, and Minkowski distance.\n",
    "- **Voting (Classification):**\n",
    "  - For classification, the algorithm identifies the `K` nearest neighbors to the test instance and assigns the class that is most frequent among these neighbors.\n",
    "- **Averaging (Regression):**\n",
    "  - For regression, KNN takes the average (or weighted average) of the target values of the `K` nearest neighbors to predict the value for the test instance.\n",
    "- **Choosing K:**\n",
    "  - The choice of `K` (the number of neighbors) is critical. A small `K` makes the model sensitive to noise, while a large `K` may smooth out predictions too much.\n",
    "- **No Training Phase:**\n",
    "  - KNN does not have a training phase, as it stores the entire dataset and makes predictions based on that dataset directly.\n",
    "- **Non-Parametric:**\n",
    "  - KNN is non-parametric, meaning it makes no assumptions about the underlying data distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Tuning Metrics\n",
    "- **`K (number_of_neighbors)`:**\n",
    "  - **Description:** The number of neighbors considered for making predictions.\n",
    "  - **Impact:** A small `K` can lead to high variance (overfitting), while a large `K` can lead to high bias (underfitting).\n",
    "  - **Default:** Typically `K=3` or `K=5`, but must be tuned based on the specific dataset.\n",
    "- **`distance_metric`:**\n",
    "  - **Description:** The function used to calculate the distance between instances (e.g., Euclidean, Manhattan, Minkowski).\n",
    "  - **Impact:** Different metrics can capture different aspects of the data, influencing the model's performance.\n",
    "  - **Default:** `Euclidean` is commonly used, but others like `Manhattan` may be better for high-dimensional data.\n",
    "- **`weight_function`:**\n",
    "  - **Description:** Determines how the neighbors contribute to the prediction (e.g., uniform weighting, distance weighting).\n",
    "  - **Impact:** Weighted KNN can improve performance by giving closer neighbors more influence.\n",
    "  - **Default:** `uniform` (all neighbors have equal weight) or `distance` (closer neighbors have more weight).\n",
    "- **`algorithm`:**\n",
    "  - **Description:** The algorithm used to compute the nearest neighbors (e.g., brute-force, KD-tree, Ball-tree).\n",
    "  - **Impact:** Affects computational efficiency, especially with large datasets.\n",
    "  - **Default:** `auto` lets the model choose the most appropriate method based on the data.\n",
    "- **`leaf_size`:**\n",
    "  - **Description:** Used in KD-tree and Ball-tree algorithms, affecting the speed of queries and memory usage.\n",
    "  - **Impact:** Smaller leaf sizes lead to faster queries at the expense of higher memory usage.\n",
    "  - **Default:** Typically `30`, but can be adjusted based on dataset size and dimensionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pros vs Cons\n",
    "\n",
    "| Pros                                                  | Cons                                                   |\n",
    "|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| Simple and easy to implement                          | Computationally expensive, especially with large datasets |\n",
    "| No training phase required                            | Performance degrades with high-dimensional data (curse of dimensionality) |\n",
    "| Can handle multi-class classification and regression tasks | Sensitive to irrelevant features and noise in the data |\n",
    "| Intuitive and easy to understand                      | Requires careful choice of `K` and distance metric      |\n",
    "| Flexible with the choice of distance metric           | Large memory requirements due to storing the entire training set |\n",

    "### Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "- **Accuracy (Classification):**\n",
    "  - **Description:** Ratio of correct predictions to total predictions.\n",
    "  - **Good Value:** Higher is better; values above 0.85 indicate strong model performance.\n",
    "  - **Bad Value:** Below 0.5 suggests poor model performance.\n",
    "- **Precision (Classification):**\n",
    "  - **Description:** Proportion of true positives among all positive predictions.\n",
    "  - **Good Value:** Higher values indicate fewer false positives, especially important in imbalanced datasets.\n",
    "  - **Bad Value:** Low values suggest many false positives.\n",
    "- **Recall (Classification):**\n",
    "  - **Description:** Proportion of actual positives correctly identified.\n",
    "  - **Good Value:** Higher values indicate fewer false negatives, important in recall-sensitive applications.\n",
    "  - **Bad Value:** Low values suggest many false negatives.\n",
    "- **F1 Score (Classification):**\n",
    "  - **Description:** Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall.\n",
    "  - **Good Value:** Higher values indicate a good balance between Precision and Recall.\n",
    "  - **Bad Value:** Low values suggest a poor balance between Precision and Recall.\n",
    "- **R-squared (Regression):**\n",
    "  - **Description:** Proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the model.\n",
    "  - **Good Value:** Higher is better; values closer to 1 indicate a strong model.\n",
    "  - **Bad Value:** Values closer to 0 suggest the model does not explain much of the variance.\n",
    "- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE) (Regression):**\n",
    "  - **Description:** Measures the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values.\n",
    "  - **Good Value:** Lower is better; values close to `0` indicate high accuracy.\n",
    "  - **Bad Value:** Higher values suggest significant prediction errors.\n",
    "- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) (Regression):**\n",
    "  - **Description:** Measures the square root of the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.\n",
    "  - **Good Value:** Lower is better; values close to `0` indicate high accuracy.\n",
    "  - **Bad Value:** Higher values suggest the model's predictions deviate significantly from actual values.\n",
    "- **AUC-ROC (Classification):**\n",
    "  - **Description:** Measures the model's ability to distinguish between classes across all thresholds.\n",
    "  - **Good Value:** Values closer to 1 indicate strong separability between classes.\n",
    "  - **Bad Value:** Values near 0.5 suggest random guessing.\n",
