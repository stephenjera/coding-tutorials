    <h2>The Zen of Python</h2>

        Beautiful is better than ugly. <br>
        Explicit is better than implicit. <br>
        Simple is better than complex. <br>
        Complex is better than complicated. <br>
        Flat is better than nested. <br>
        Sparse is better than dense. <br>
        Readability counts. <br>
        Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules. <br>
        Although practicality beats purity. <br>
        Errors should never pass silently. <br>
        Unless explicitly silenced. <br>
        In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess. <br>
        There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it. <br>
        Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch. <br>
        Now is better than never. <br>
        Although never is often better than <b>*right*</b> now. <br>
        If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea. <br>
        If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea. <br>
        Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those! <br>
